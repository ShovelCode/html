<h1>Elegant Software Principles</h1>

<h4>This Page</h4>
<p>This page will aim to only display the front of Unicode and have no images or tables so as to make it viewable easily with
the Lynx browser, and the reader mode of mobile browsers.  Code blocks will also not be in this page. Other pages will
be linked from here for investigating Unicode display, code, and tables.  Later on possibly black/white/gray graphs and 
images that are meant to be viewed with an ereader.  There are not timestamps here.  Time doesn't exist on this page. This
site is a soft part of your consciousness for you to think.  </p>

<h4>Value the Invisible</h4>
<p>The kid in Terminator II was wasting time when he made the little Atari Portfolio waste time outputting digits.
All he needed was an indicator that the program didn't crash while it worked invisibly in the background.
That is software, the invisible machine inside the physical machine.  The spirit machine.</p>

<h4>Oneness</h4>
<p>Tauheed the Arabs call it.  I have often said design is four things: What to include, what to exclude, what to
combine, and what to seperate.  Computers don't <i>have</i> to be the universal machine, they can and will
and should be dedicated to things. How One should things be?  Why?  </p>

<h4>Vector Displays</h4>
<p>Pixels are overrated, with vector displays we in software bend light to our will, a more pure display of images that
matter.[more coming later]</p>

<h4>Skeuomorphism</h4>
<p>Buttons should be tastefully ornate to indicate the role they have in a system.</p>

<h4>We Should Love-Hate APL</h4>
<p>APL is 50+ years old programming language that excels at multidimensional array manipulation.It's standard form
uses many nonstandard characters.  A language called J exists that synthesizes the symbols into a standard character
language.  APL is a mad but beautiful reminder that informatics is not necessarily about computers or science.  It 
can also be Reason Alone and is not bond by ancient Roman letters.  It forces us to think and innovate with the design
of its specialized editors.  Perhaps it has been incubating for the era of tablet computers where its special
symbols are just a capacitive touch away instead of contrained to keyboard stickers.  It also acts as a
convenient notation which while mathematical in appearance retains the beauty we love in code: <i>no ambiguity</i>.</p>

<h4>Execute-only hardware is a great idea, isn't it?</h4>
Software gives the spirit to machines to be tools.  We don't refuse a hammer because it can't change itself into a 
screwdriver.  It is productive to keep self-change seperated until a fire-tested solution has been developed.  Enjoy
without guilt a tablet, phone, laptop, media player, or video game console with all of their fantastic limitations.
Then take great joy in the machines you develop on -- the machines that reflect on themselves and make changes.  The iPad
was said to have been Steve Jobs' favorite device.  This is because it was the true successor to his old Macintosh -- a machine
that knew what it was and was meant to be enjoyed for its execution of programs only.  The iMac was and continues to be
a dual role machine as executor and developer.  

<h4>Cultural Diversity in Programming Language Design</h4>
<p>Looking at a list of major programming languages and their creators you will notice that programming languages are like
suicide notes -- they are mostly written by <i>white men</i>.  Let's use a softer term. <i>The educated middle class of
the traditional Western countries.</i> One exception to this is Ruby designed by the Yukihiro Matsumoto of Japan. This is 
refreshing and it is my sincere hope that developing nations entering first world status not just learn the art of
programming language craftsmanship but make unique specimens and features for their own programming languages that give
us traditional westerners an <i>Aha!</i> moment.  I expect such things to come out of(internally
not diaspora) Russia/Eastern Europe, Egypt/Israel/
Turkey/Greater Middle East, China, and India in the coming decades.</p>
<h4>Lisp and Haskell</h4>
<p>The general activities of software developers can be split into two as systems programming and application programming. 
These further can be split into two as construction (setting and getting) and algorithm research. 
Thus there are four quadrants. Most of the computing needs of humanity are systems programming and construction. 
This includes communication, text, images, videos, and database management. Essentially software only needs to replace paper, ink,
radio, and television. Mutation is not just a result of limited memory in those domains, it is the desire. 
Lisp, Haskell, and the rest of the research languages are for exotic algorithms in the neatly garbage collected application layer. 
There has been no need for them outside of esoteric math applications(which are very honorable) until recently. 
To their communities I say be patient your day is coming you have labored without payment, growing these
research languages in the dark like a garden of mushrooms, but good old construction is here to stay.</p>
<h4>File Formats</h4>
<p>In my car I listen to the recordings of a bunch of guys 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SmogonU/videos">discussing the theory of competitive Pokemon battling</a>. Constantly. 
These recordings after they happen live are uploaded as a dreaded Flash Video on YouTube.  Another webpage can take the URL
of this YouTube video and convert its sound into an mp3 file.  This video was viewed and converted on a proprietary closed
browser running on a proprietary closed operating system.  Then these mp3 files were moved onto a flashdrive with a 
proprietary closed file manager.  Then I took that flashdrive and and plugged it into the USB port of my car's audio system.
It starts up insantly and has no user acccount control.  This audio software in my car is proprietary and closed.
So much proprietary software but what's that?  It doesn't matter because the open standard file format (mp3) is supported from
a standard interface (USB).  USB given to us from the electric engineers.  The mp3 format is the software developer's child.
The lesson here is clear:  Open File Formats (and storage formats for that matter) matter more than open source software.  Relax
and take joy in that.</p>

<h4>Rust and Go</h4>
<p>I've mentioned before the overly bloated software that developers have created.  This is understandable given the youth of
Informatics.  It is a younger field that Psychology.  Much like Psychology it has difficult in creating unified vocabulary
and has blind schools of thought.  Class based Object Oriented Programming, especially on the JVM and .NET may be one of
those blind alleys.  Given more time to contemplate we see the birth of Rust and Go, languages carefully crafted for a
purpose.  Rust for kernels and systems programming and Go for application layer software.  Go does away with class OO and 
instead has functions associated with structures accessed with a dot (looks the same but is not).   Go applications run
on a bunch of little VMs instead of one big one like Java.  Rust and Go imparticular have taken great influence from
research languages like Haskell and Lisp.  Common Lisp still has a role of course.  The needs that bore them are parallelism,
speed, the usual safety concerns, and internationalization(Unicode characters allowed from the get-go).  Rust
and Go see rapid development every day on GitHub.  Is it another blind alley or the new carefully selected path?</p>
<h4>We can't love Linux too much</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3019852/linux/how-linux-won-without-winning.html">This post</a> from Infoworld echoes
my sentiment that Android and ChromeOS don't count as "being Linux" and that Linux is not really "winning" anything, and that's
fine.  I tell others that Linux is a kernel which I describe as the invisible part of an operating system.  Alternatively I
call it the operating system for servers.  The Free and Open Source <i>process</i>  is more important than any single project. 
Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, and Linux will all fade one day but the FOSS process won't.  Git is Linus Torvald's greatest 
accomplishment.  </p>
<h4>What we can learn from the Atari Portfolio</h4>
<p>The Atari Portfolio was the small computer that the kid in Terminator 2 used to hack an ATM.  It had a monochromatic display that
could only draw straight lines and characters.  It booted immediately to a DOS clone and could only really make
text files and Lotus inspired spreadsheets.  This is an example of true computing with a focus and purpose.  I guarantee that thing
starts up faster than today's ultrabooks and can produce useful data with its spreadsheet program.  It came out in 1989 and can
still talk up to a Windows Vista computer.  It didn't need color or images or even user account control.  Single user. Single
purpose, nothing unneeded for that purpose and it did this all fast.  Additionally being a DOS clone OS it shows that <i>not
everyone wants Unix</i>.  A FOSS 3D printed clone of the Atari Portfolio is a project someone should look at.</p>
<h4>A Loveletter to the Kindle</h4>
<p>Even the Atari Portfolio had a speaker for indication beeps.  First let me sing odes to the Kindle for forgoing any kind of 
speaker and being a modern computing device that <i>shuts the fuck up</i> out of the box.  A device with purpose.  It can be 
read in direct sunlight, and can display most standard HTML, thus inspiring this website.  I have on it all the works of Plato,
the Oracle Java reference, and War and Peace just to name a few.  Thousands of pages compressed into a snug device.  In an era where
every gizmo has time wasting games the Kindle and e-readers of its domain return computing back to the original purpose of saving
us time and space.</p>
<h4>Chrome OS</h4>
<p>My little ChromeOS laptop with only 2GB of memory and 10 GB of SSD is my most used computing device.  In fact this article is
being written with it right now.  It is Linux based but very much Google's OS.  It is what a corporate OS should be, fast, focused,
batteries included, and despite being Google not bombarding me with <i>advertisement built into the OS</i>.  I can't say the same
for Windows 10.</p>

<h4>Energy Technology and Electrical Engineering</h4>

<a href="http://www.pppl.gov/news">North American fusion coming along as well</a><br>
<a href="https://www.soylent.com/">12 Soylent Bottles:  30 USD</a><br>

<p>That is quite a bit of interesting news there.  I consider this all related.  In the era of
abundant clean energy, mountains can be made into new plains of land, all topped off with 
commodity computers that can read websites such as these.  I think Palau, The Marshall Islands,
and Micronesia could benefit from Chinese sand building.  Perhaps those islands are a shallow
flooded larger island.  The fusion reactor is best for continents and eventually for nuclear
electric space craft. </p>

<h4>Soylent</h4>
<p>I consider this energy related news because Soylent and water are the theoretical perfect fuel
for humanity (coffee being the nitrus booster).  Rosa Labs really ought to quit wasting time with
marketing to techie first worlders.  A push in India and China could make the product globally
ubiquitous and make the founders billionaires. Soylent could also see other exotic uses. Imagine
a clean <i>bioengine</i> that we feed with the same stuff we feed ourselves.  I've begun feeding it
to a cactus. </p>

<h4>Some general blogging</h4>
<p>
Ok rant time.  Hardware engineers have given us a paradise to work with
but we software engineers have ruined it with  overly bulky solutions
to problems that don't exist while ignoring real ones.

Why has it taken 25 years to have standardized HTML for displaying mathematical
and scientific notation?  Aren't we supposed to be their friends?
But no we are perverted and only care about trannies posting selfies
of their buttholes on Tumblr. 

We suck at entrepreneurship.  As Mr. Trump has demonstrated just being rich
does not qualify you for anything.

Facebook is way too much code for its purpose.
So are most operating systems including the open source stuff.

Some projects like Ericsson and WhatsApp are true progress. 
Also hipster projects like kindlelynx.weebly.com :P
<br>
<a href="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/unicode-sample-3-2.html">Unicode Test Page</a><br>
<br>
<p>
This is a website designed to be as HTML 5 Compliant as possible while also being
navigable in both e-reader tablets such as the Amazon Kindle and text-only webbrowsers such as
the Lynx browser.</p>
<br>
LOC for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">nytimes.com</a>: > 3500 <br>

I guess that means we need some ground rules. 
<list> 
<li> text only </li> 
<li> black and white only </li>
<li> no images or sounds </li>
<li> no text lines too wide</li>
<li> Weebly adds some code for publishing</li>
<li> w3 validation </li>
<li> there are 16 errors from weebly's code alone </li>
<li> This will be a single column page, three column coming later</li>
<li> I have tried a table out, and will also test some advanced <br>
Unicode sets, Lynx may have a problem with those <br></li>
<li>I am currently investigating RTL and vertical text</li><br>
</list>

I would like to point out that the Kindle's browser can display<br>
the vertical Mongolian text but can't render it correctly. <br>
The letters are all disconnected.<br>
Also the Reader view in iOS Safari re-renders the vertical text<br>
to be horizontal.<br><br>
I've been thinking that vertical text pages would have to be<br>
custom tailored to have only horizontal scrolling since that<br>
is the natural reading order for them and these pages are <br>
designed to have only one scrolling direction.<br>

Clearly though the Kindle and Lynx are very different browsers.<br>
It would be fair to call the Lynx an anglophonic browser that<br>
by it's very nature declines to support many HTML features.<br>
So a page for it will have different ground rules.<br>
<list>
<li>Text Only</li>
<li>Lots of br tags and a tags</li>
<li>no center tags or header tags</li>
<li>perhaps no p tag either</li>
<li>Basic Unicode/old ASCII/English only</li>
<li>Only vertical scrolling</li>
</list><br>
