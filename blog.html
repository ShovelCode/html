<h1>A Software Development Blog</h1>

<h4>This Page</h4>
<p>This page will aim to only display the front of Unicode and have no images or tables so as to make it viewable easily with
the Lynx browser, and the reader mode of mobile browsers.  Code blocks will also not be in this page. Other pages will
be linked from here for investigating Unicode display, code, and tables.  Later on possibly black/white/gray graphs and 
images that are meant to be viewed with an ereader.  There are not timestamps here.  Time doesn't exist on this page. This
site is a soft part of your consciousness for you to think.  </p>

<h4>We can't love Linux too much</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3019852/linux/how-linux-won-without-winning.html">This post</a> from Infoworld echoes
my sentiment that Android and ChromeOS don't count as "being Linux" and that Linux is not really "winning" anything, and that's
fine.  I tell others that Linux is a kernel which I describe as the invisible part of an operating system.  Alternatively I
call it the operating system for servers.  The Free and Open Source <i>process</i>  is more important than any single project. 
Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, and Linux will all fade one day but the FOSS process won't.  Git is Linus Torvald's greatest 
accomplishment.  </p>
<h4>What we can learn from the Atari Portfolio</h4>
<p>The Atari Portfolio was the small computer that the kid in Terminator 2 used to hack an ATM.  It had a monochromatic display that
could only draw straight lines and characters.  It booted immediately to a DOS clone and could only really make
text files and Lotus inspired spreadsheets.  This is an example of true computing with a focus and purpose.  I guarantee that thing
starts up faster than today's ultrabooks and can produce useful data with its spreadsheet program.  It came out in 1989 and can
still talk up to a Windows Vista computer.  It didn't need color or images or even user account control.  Single user. Single
purpose, nothing unneeded for that purpose and it did this all fast.  Additionally being a DOS clone OS it shows that <i>not
everyone wants Unix</i>.  A FOSS 3D printed clone of the Atari Portfolio is a project someone should look at.</p>
<h4>A Loveletter to the Kindle</h4>
<p>Even the Atari Portfolio had a speaker for indication beeps.  First let me sing odes to the Kindle for forgoing any kind of 
speaker and being a modern computing device that <i>shuts the fuck up</i> out of the box.  A device with purpose.  It can be 
read in direct sunlight, and can display most standard HTML, thus inspiring this website.  I have on it all the works of Plato,
the Oracle Java reference, and War and Peace just to name a few.  Thousands of pages compressed into a snug device.  In an era where
every gizmo has time wasting games the Kindle and e-readers of its domain return computing back to the original purpose of saving
us time and space.</p>
<h4>Chrome OS</h4>
<p>My little ChromeOS laptop with only 2GB of memory and 10 GB of SSD is my most used computing device.  In fact this article is
being written with it right now.  It is Linux based but very much Google's OS.  It is what a corporate OS should be, fast, focused,
batteries included, and despite being Google not bombarding me with <i>advertisement built into the OS</i>.  I can't say the same
for Windows 10.</p>
<h4>Energy Technology and Electrical Engineering</h4>

Some Germans say they have a universal energy device</a><br>

<h4>Some general blogging</h4>
<p>
Ok rant time.  Hardware engineers have given us a paradise to work with
but we software engineers have ruined it with  overly bulky solutions
to problems that don't exist while ignoring real ones.

Why has it taken 25 years to have standardized HTML for displaying mathematical
and scientific notation?  Aren't we supposed to be their friends?
But no we are perverted and only care about trannies posting selfies
of their buttholes on Tumblr. 

We suck at entrepreneurship.  As Mr. Trump has demonstrated just being rich
does not qualify you for anything.

Facebook is way too much code for its purpose.
So are most operating systems including the open source stuff.

Some projects like Ericsson and WhatsApp are true progress. 
Also hipster projects like kindlelynx.weebly.com :P
<br>
<a href="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/unicode-sample-3-2.html">Unicode Test Page</a><br>
<br>

This is a website designed to be as HTML 5 Compliant as possible while also being
navigable in both e-reader tablets such as the Amazon Kindle and text-only webbrowsers such as
the Lynx browser.
<br>
LOC for this page: < 150 <br>
LOC for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">nytimes.com</a>: > 3500 <br>

I guess that means we need some ground rules. 
<list> 
<li> text only </li> 
<li> black and white only </li>
<li> no images or sounds </li>
<li> no text lines too wide</li>
<li> Weebly adds some code for publishing</li>
<li> w3 validation </li>
<li> there are 16 errors from weebly's code alone </li>
<li> This will be a single column page, three column coming later</li>
<li> I have tried a table out, and will also test some advanced <br>
Unicode sets, Lynx may have a problem with those <br></li>
<li>I am currently investigating RTL and vertical text</li><br>
</list>

I would like to point out that the Kindle's browser can display<br>
the vertical Mongolian text but can't render it correctly. <br>
The letters are all disconnected.<br>
Also the Reader view in iOS Safari re-renders the vertical text<br>
to be horizontal.<br><br>
I've been thinking that vertical text pages would have to be<br>
custom tailored to have only horizontal scrolling since that<br>
is the natural reading order for them and these pages are <br>
designed to have only one scrolling direction.<br>

Clearly though the Kindle and Lynx are very different browsers.<br>
It would be fair to call the Lynx an anglophonic browser that<br>
by it's very nature declines to support many HTML features.<br>
So a page for it will have different ground rules.<br>
<list>
<li>Text Only</li>
<li>Lots of br tags and a tags</li>
<li>no center tags or header tags</li>
<li>perhaps no p tag either</li>
<li>Basic Unicode/old ASCII/English only</li>
<li>Only vertical scrolling</li>
</list><br>
